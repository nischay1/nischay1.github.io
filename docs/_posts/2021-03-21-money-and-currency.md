# What is a Contract?
Contracts are one of the fundamental building blocks of civilization.  
A contract is a instruction for an entity to execute a specific sequence of actions in a specific time range.

Contracts range from something as simple as a request to "give me a banana (right now)" to something as complex as a stock option.


# What is a Market?
A market is a network for exchanging specific contracts.

Like any other network, a market needs 3 essential conditins to be functional:
- The presence of (more than one) entities
- Their desire to exchange the specific contracts
- A Protocol for the exchange

Failing any of these conditions, there is no market for a contract.


# What is Economic Value?   
Theoretically, economic value is the measure of potential benifit that an entity derives from by a contract.

Thus different entites will see different economic value in the same contract.

This difference in percieved economic value creates a desire to exchange the contracts. 
If entityA values contractA more than contractB and entityB values contractB more than contractA, entityB will desire to exchange contractA for contractB.

# What is Money?
Money is a measure of economic value.

# What is a currency?
A currency is an abstraction over money.

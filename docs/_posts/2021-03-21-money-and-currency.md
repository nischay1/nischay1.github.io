#What is a Contract?
Contracts are one of the fundamental building blocks of civilization.
A contract is a instruction for an entity to perform a specific sequence of actions.

Contracts range from something as simple as a request to "give me your banana" to something as complex as a stock option.

#What is a Market?
A market is formed when contracts are exchanged.
A market is the interaction of entities exchanging contracts. 
The key here is the interaction of (more than one) entities. 
Without interaction, there is no market. With a single entity, there is no market.


#What is Economic Value?   
Theoretically, economic value is the measure of potential benifit that an entity derives from by a contract.

Thus different entites will see different economic value in the same contract.

This difference in percieved economic value creates a market. 
If entityA values contractA more than contractB and entityB values contractB more than contractA, contractB with be exchanged with contractA and a market is created.

#What is Money?
Money is a medium of storing an exchanging economic value in markets.
To understand what this means, let's first understand markets and economic value.

# Contracts
A _contract_ is an instruction for an entity to execute a specific sequence of actions in a specific time range.
Forming an executing contracts are a fundamental property of biological life right from the cellular level.
Organisms are constantly forming biological contracts with other organisms, thus creating the complex interdependent system that we call a biosphere.
The more complex the organism, the more complex their contracts. 
Only _living_ entities can form contracts. In fact, the ability to form contracts is one of the things that make something _alive_.  

Most contracts are either an instruction to deliver a particular object or perform a certain action at a specific time.

# Value   
Theoretically, _value_ is the measure of potential benifit that an entity _percieves_ in a contract.
Given that a contract's value is purely based on perception, each entity can percieve a unique value in the same contract.
This can lead to a difference in the percieved value and can spark a desire to exchange contracts.

If entityA values contractA more than contractB and entityB values contractB more than contractA, entityB will _desire_ to exchange contractA for contractB.
exchange of contracts is called a trade. A trade is a contract in itself- a contract to exchange specific contracts.

Note that this desire may or not be conscious.

# Markets
A market is a _network_ for exchanging specific contracts.
The size and complexiety of markets increase with the complexiety of the organism.
Simple organisms form smaller markets while complex organisms are capable of participating in large markets.

Like any network, a market needs 3 essential conditions to be functional, regardless of size:
- The participation of (more than one) _entities_
- The _desire_ of these entities to exchange the specific contracts
- A _protocol_ for this exchange

Failing any of these conditions, the network is dysfunctional.

Now that we have defined Contracts, Values and Markets let's look at some examples illustrating different contracts found in .

# Money/Wealth
Money/Wealth is measurable economic value.  
The words _money_, _wealth_ and _currency_ are often used interchangable in the modern human society. 
Currency is a very recent invention, while money/wealth have existed as a concept, for as long as human civilization.
More wealth translates to higher economic value and thus higher economic status across all human societies.

# Currency
A currency is an abstract entity (physical or virtual) in which wealth (i.e. economic value) is measured, stored and exchanged. 
Currencies need to have the following properties, at minimum:
- They are a medium of exchanging wealth (economic value). 
- They are a store of wealth (economic value).
- They facilitate the measurement of wealth (economic value).

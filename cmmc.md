# Contracts
A _contract_ is an instruction for an entity to execute a specific sequence of actions in a defined time range.  
Most (but not all) contracts are either an instruction to provide a particular object or service within a defined time range.

Thus a contract will have the following properties:
- The action to perform
- The time range to perform the action in 
- The entity to perform the action 


# Value   
Theoretically, _value_ is the potential benifit that an entity _percieves_ in a contract.
Given that a contract's value is purely based on perception, each entity can percieve a unique value in the same contract.
This can lead to a difference in the percieved value and can spark a desire to exchange contracts.

If entityA values contractA more than contractB and entityB values contractB more than contractA, entityB will _desire_ to exchange contractA for contractB.
exchange of contracts is called a trade. A trade is a contract in itself- a contract to exchange specific contracts.

Note that this desire may or not be conscious.

# Markets
A market is a _network_ for exchanging specific contracts.
The size and complexiety of markets increase with the complexiety of the organism.
Simple organisms form smaller markets while complex organisms are capable of participating in large markets.

Like any network, a market needs 3 essential conditions to be functional, regardless of size:
- The participation of (more than one) _entities_
- The _desire_ of these entities to exchange the specific contracts
- A _protocol_ for this exchange

Failing any of these conditions, the network is dysfunctional.


## Biological, Social and Economic contracts/markets

Forming an executing contracts is a fundamental characteristic of biological life, right from the cellular level.  
The more complex the organism, the more complex the contracts they form. 
Only _living_ entities are capable of forming contracts.   
In fact, the ability to form contracts is a unique characteristic of being _alive_.

Organisms are constantly forming biological contracts with other organisms, thus creating the complex interdependent system that we call the biosphere. 

Similarly, humans are contantly forming social contracts with other humans, thus creating the complex interdependent system that we call the modern society.
The main distinction between _social_ and _biological_ contracts is the dependence of social contracts on _conscious_ interaction. 
Depending on how you define consciousness, _social_ contracts can be simply classified as complex extension of _biological_ contracts.  

_Economic_ contracts are exchangable social contracts with measurable value. 
For instance, _entering a marraige_ is a social (and arguably biological) contract in humans while a _owning a corporation_ is an economic contract.  
If it's value is not measurable, it's not economic. 
Humans can often exchange economic contracts for social contracts, thus assigning an economic value to non-economic social contracts. 
This is where the line between economic and non-economic social contracts gets blurry.

# Institution
An institution is a social abstraction of a single biological entity (i.e. a human) or a group thereof.
An economic institution is a social institution which can possess economic value.

The most basic economic institution is the _individual_. 
More complex institutions like families, nations and corporations are formed by social/economic contracts between individuals. 

# Money, Wealth and Currency
The words _money_, _wealth_ and _currency_ are often used interchangably in the modern human society. 
Currency is a very recent invention, while money/wealth have existed as a concept, for as long as human civilization.

## Money
Money is measurable economic value associated with an economic institution or an economic contract.
Institutions can gain/lose money/wealth by exchanging economic contracts. 

## Wealth
Wealth is the money accumulated by an instituion. 
The boundary between wealth money is very blurry except that the term 'wealth' is never associated with an economic contract.
More wealth translates to higher economic value and thus higher economic status.

## Currency
A currency is an abstract entity (physical or virtual) in which wealth (i.e. economic value) is measured, stored and exchanged. 
Currencies need to have the following properties, at minimum:
- They are a medium of exchanging money (economic value). 
- They are a store of wealth (accumulated economic value).  
- They facilitate the measurement of money/wealth (economic value).
